This repository contains my analysis on Life expectency dataset and commonwealth dataset.

## Life Expectancy of Countries

For the life expectancy analysis, the dataset has been collected from https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_313_201907_Threatened%20Species.csv
And the complete analysis is implemented on R language.

The Rmd file contains the code for the analysis and the html file and pdf file is the final output.

## Commonwealth Games Analysis

The dataset is created from web using PowerBI. The sites are https://www.birmingham2022.com/medals and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales_at_the_2022_Commonwealth_Games. 

The final output is displayed in the pdf file. And the powerBI file is also uploaded.
